# Mentor Connect Log

This log is to record the key points from weekly discussion with mentor, Rohit Padmanabhan.

## Week 1

-   Discussion on dissertation outline
-   Feedback
    -   Please add a bit more details on why you are selecting the methodology. In the background you are mentioning that the key could be "Instead, the model focuses on small visual imperfections in the image background." Please make that prominent instead of focusing on methodology which I see in both abstract and introduction.
    -   It could be worth while to add a sentence or two on why there could be a need for external classification, while there is a regulatory push to have internal markers from the tools themselves when images are generated ( possibility of actors to create their own models) .
    -   Please add more time for literature review concurrent to your setup week as one week is too little time to go through literature.
    -   Too me the titles are little here and there; Introduction background are covering other topics as well. Attached here is a good sample template to use, if BITS is not insisting on a particular format post the signature page.

## Week 2

-   Discussion on initial plan
-   Feedback
    -   Setup git repository
    -   Create logs to track the work done
    -   Explore cloud solutions for faster compute
    -   Look for more realistic data
    -   Focus more on literature review
